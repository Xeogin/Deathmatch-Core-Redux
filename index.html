<h1>Prepare for...</h1><ul>
<li>Moving faster, unlimited sprinting, not tripping over the small props and a bit lower gravity than the usual!</li>
<li>Spawning with a bow and some armor. It goes quick, so use the improved chargers and figure out the new ammo spawns!</li>
<li>Weapons NOT automatically swapping because you ran over some ammo and background reloading only taking 2 seconds!</li>
<li>Bullets to hurt your chest and stomach a LOT more. Guns have been rebalanced for it and the shotgun is killer!</li>
<li>Some of the other players actually being bots. Props and bots don't get along well, so expect some glitches!</li>
<li>The RPG to come with only 1 rocket. It's a mean rocket though, so try not to get caught in it's splash damage!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Additional Info:</h1><ul>
<li>Some props have been specially tweaked, such as the truck on dm_overwatch and explosive barrels on dm_powerhouse.</li>
<li>The bots are TERRIBLE on non-stock maps other than dm_avalon_b1 since they don't know where to go.</li>
<li>All kill-streak and say sounds use in-game assets. Try to get 20 kills in a row and laugh it off if you can't.</li>
</ul>
Thank you all for your feedback and suggestions and a special thanks to Fay the Space Dog for coming up with bot names!
