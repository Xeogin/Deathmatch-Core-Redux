<h2>Highlighting various styles of play, this server offers the following modes:</h2><ul>
<li>Training:  The first mode you're likely to see as the server defaults to maps offering it if no one votes. It features the best bots the game and they've been given a 25% speed boost over you. In addition to your normal spawn weapons, you start with a crossbow and 15 armor. It's also infinite sprint and gravity is slightly lower than normal. A great way to get into the game for beginners or a warm-up before a match.</li></br>
<li>Low Grav:  All maps that start with "dm_killbox" are in this mode. As expected, gravity is greatly reduced and fall damage has been disabled. In addition to the Training mode weapons, you also start with a shotgun and an SMG nade. To makes things more interesting, now everyone has the 25% speed boost.</li></br>
<li>Standard:  This is the mode any maps not specifically configured default to. You spawn with the same load-out as Training mode, but that's the only change.</li></br>
<li>Competitive:  No spawn protection, no special load-outs, basically stock everything except for the finely tuned maps we've played over and over until the only thing left on the table is each other's skill. Even if you don't feel up to the challenge, do come in and spectate. This game has a high skill ceiling and plenty to learn.</li></br>
<li>Fishing:  When you're looking for something different or just want to get away from it all. These special "z" prefixed maps spawn you with only a gravity gun, but there will be fishing rods and "bait" nearby. Put the bait on a hook then bob it around in the water and nearly any asset from HL2 could spawn. You may even reel in few of the secret items and learn there's more to the map than first meets the eye...</li></ul>
<h3>In addition to these modes, you may come to notice other subtle changes. A quick summary of the one's made intentionally include:</h3><ul>
<li>The ability to walk through small, stationary props and a few props becoming fixed in place. This is to help prevent becoming stuck at spawn and also helps increase the game's performance.</li>
<li>The weapon aren't exactly the same; the most noticeable changes are the buffs to the pistol, SMG and AR2, the slightly increased damage to the chest and stomach, the Super Charger maxes out at 150 and some of the ammo spawns have been swapped with lower capacity versions or armor batteries. This rebalance brings things closer to modern games, without much interference with the established meta.</li>
<li>SLAM spawns have been replaced with health vials, RPG rockets with a bundle of crossbow bolts and shotgun buckshot with a SLAM. Additionally RPGs only come with a single rocket, but it's splash damage has been increased. SLAM spawns are also only a single SLAM and their damage has been decreased. These changes in a way help with balancing, but they're more to keep things interesting and freshen up the game play.</li>
<li>Some stationary props can now be moved, some have increased mass to improve prop-jumping and some map bugs have been fixed, such as the AR2 spawn on dm_resistance or the forgotten ladder on dm_ff_wild_wild_west_beta6. I've also begun to throw in some secrets; like have you ever wondered why there's 357 ammo on dm_restistance, but no magnum spawn? Well now there is one and it's in the hiding place it should've been all along.</li></ul>
I'd like to thank everyone for you continued feedback and suggestions and a special thanks to Fay the Space Dog for coming up with bot names!
