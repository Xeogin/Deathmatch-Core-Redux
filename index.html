<h3>July 2019 News:</h3>
Added a Surf mode, more Jump maps and some comp commands back in. Also simplified voting and fixed some "noblock" and explosion splash damage bugs
<h3>Main modes:</h3><ul>
<li>Competitive: Basically stock everything except for some fine tuning to the weapon/items spawns on some maps. Many of the chat commands to control matches are enabled. (Release Candidate)</li></br>
<li>Headshot Only: You spawn with a magnum that has infinite ammo, but it can only kill by getting a headshot. You also spawn with a bow and occasionally a shotgun glitches in. Try shooting the ground or walls to boost off them (Release Candidate)</li></br>
<li>Jumps: Use strafe jumps and bhop to complete each map. A persistent checkpoint system is in place to allow you to save your progress</li></br>
<li>Killbox: Gravity is greatly reduced, fall damage has been disabled and you’ve been given a 25% speed boost. In addition to the Practice mode weapons, you also start with a shotgun and an SMG nade</li></br>
<li>Practice: Face off against some of the most realistic bots in the game. In addition to your normal spawn weapons, you start with a crossbow, 15 armor and have infinite sprint</li></br>
<li>Standard: You spawn with the same loadout as Practice, but that's the only major change over stock</li></br>
<li>Surf: Slide down ramps to gain speed and use increased air control to help with transitions. The same checkpoint system as Jumps is enabled here. (Release Candidate)</li>
<h3>Special modes:</h3><ul>
<li>Capture the Flag: You receive 10 points for each capture</li></br>
<li>Fishing: You spawn with only a gravity gun, but there are rods and bait nearby. Put the bait on a hook then bob it around in the water and nearly any asset from HL2 could spawn as well as a few secrets</li>
</ul><h3>In addition to these modes, you may notice other subtle changes:</h3>
<ul><li>To help prevent becoming stuck when spawning in, you can walk through small props when they’re stationary and a few props have been fixed in place. Some props have also had their mass increased to improve prop-jumping and various map bugs have been fixed, such as the AR2 spawn on dm_resistance and the forgotten ladder on dm_ff_wild_wild_west_beta6. I've also thrown in a few secrets; like have you ever wondered why there's 357 ammo on dm_resistance, but no magnum spawn? Well now there’s one hidden in the drain pipe near the wheelbarrows.</li></br>
<li>To help rebalance the game some SLAM spawns have been replaced with health vials and shotgun buckshot with a single SLAM (unless you're playing Competitive mode.) Additionally, RPGs only come with one rocket. Damage to legs has been reduced as well as slightly to arms, the Super Charger maxes out at 150 armor and some of the ammo spawns have been swapped with lower capacity versions or armor batteries</li></ul>
I'd like to thank everyone for you continued feedback and suggestions and a special thanks to Fay the Space Dog for coming up with bot names!
