<h3>April 2019 News:</h3>
The server has been upgraded to much better hardware, allowing for the bump to 100 tick and 32 players. It also has a static IP now, so please add it to your favorites! Additionally a "High Kill" mode is in the planning stages, where you will spawn with a crossbow that has infinite ammo and it will have more force than normal in order to move props. This mode will probably merge with Headshot Only

<h3>This server offers the following modes:</h3><ul>
<li>Capture the Flag: Same as stock/Competitive, but in addition you receive 10 points for each flag capture (Release Candidate)</li></br>
<li>Competitive: Basically stock everything except for some fine tuning to the maps</li></br>
<li>Fishing: You spawn with only a gravity gun, but there are fishing rods and "bait" nearby. Put the bait on a hook then bob it around in the water and nearly any asset from HL2 could spawn as well as a few secrets to discover (Release Candidate)</li></br>
<li>Headshot Only: You spawn with only a magnum, but it has infinite ammo and only hitting the head causes death. Try shooting the ground or walls for an additional boost (Release Candidate)</li></br>
<li>Jumps: Featuring the “easiest” jump maps beatable with stock settings (Release Candidate)</li></br>
<li>Low Grav: Gravity is greatly reduced, fall damage has been disabled and you’ve been given a 25% speed boost. In addition to the Practice mode weapons, you also start with a shotgun and an SMG nade</li></br>
<li>Practice: Face off against some of most realistic bots in the game. In addition to your normal spawn weapons, you start with a crossbow, 15 armor and have infinite sprint</li></br>
<li>Standard: You spawn with the same weapons as Practice, but that's the only major change over stock</li></br>
<li>Team Play: TDM with up to 31 bots, it's crashes the server half the time but it's fun! (Early Access)</li>
</ul><h3>In addition to these modes, you may notice other subtle changes:</h3>
<ul><li>To help prevent becoming stuck when spawning in, you can walk through small, stationary props and a few props have been fixed in place. Inversely, some larger props that are usual fixed in place can now be moved, others have increased mass to improve prop-jumping and various map bugs have been fixed, such as the AR2 spawn on dm_resistance or the forgotten ladder on dm_ff_wild_wild_west_beta6. I've also begun to throw in some secrets; like have you ever wondered why there's 357 ammo on dm_resistance, but no magnum spawn? Well now there is one and it's in the hiding place it should've been all along. Try and find it!</li></br>
<li>To help rebalance the game some, SLAM spawns have been replaced with health vials and shotgun buckshot spawns with a single SLAM (unless you're playing Competitive mode.) Additionally, RPGs only come with a one rocket, but it's splash damage has been increased. Damage to legs has been reduced as well as slightly to arms, the Super Charger maxes out at 150 armor and some of the ammo spawns have been swapped with lower capacity versions or armor batteries</li></ul>
I'd like to thank everyone for you continued feedback and suggestions and a special thanks to Fay the Space Dog for coming up with bot names!
