What's the goal here?</br>
Show off the best parts of HL2:DM in a way that keeps Pros happy while those with less experience can have fun too.</br>
Full details on that in <a href="goo.gl/lZB8gh">this Google Sheet</a>.
</br>
What's changed with props?</br>
They've been edited to make more sense mass-wise. Somethings are now too large or heavy to pick up.</br>
Small props and the trap blade can be walked through when they're not moving, so there's less tripping and getting stuck.</br>
Some props that were locked in-place previously can now be moved. E.g. the truck on Overwatch.</br>
Explosive barrels and other destructable props now take 2 minutes to respawn. Twice the normal.</br>
</br>
What's changed with weapons/health/armor?</br>
Helped balanced Combine vs Rebel by multipling chest damage done to rebels by 2. Mr. Jingle finally has an upside.</br>
The pistols damage has been reduced by 1, ar2 damage by 2, shotgun pellets by 3 and magnum by 30.</br>
Double-barrel shotgun blasts have a basic lag compensation fix to improve reg.</br>
Mag and RPG have a built-in zoom since not everyone knows about toggle_zoom. It's further than norm too, but it makes a noise.</br>
SLAMs have been replaced by Combine Mines. Not very useful, but cute when trying to flip back over.</br>
Orb ammo spawns as now armor batteries and rocket ammo spawns are orbs. This works surprisingly well on most maps.</br>
Due to less orbs, max armor via Super Charger is reduced to only 150.</br>
</br>
What's coming soon?</br>
Spawning will fully invisible to make spawn killing/camping no longer an issue.</br>
Kill, Specate and Jointeam are suppose to be time delayed to prevent trolling. For now they're blocked.</br>
Removing deafening from explosions. They get in the way of conversations and tends to get stuck.</br>
Reducing knock-back from being shot. Nades are fine, bullets shouldn't make you fly.</br>
Triggers to play built-in sounds and voices. Adds character.</pre>
