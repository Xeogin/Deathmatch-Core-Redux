<h1>What's the goal here?</h1>
Show off the best parts of HL2:DM in a way that keeps Pros happy while those with less experience can have fun too.
General changes are listed below and futher details are in <a href="https://goo.gl/lZB8gh">this Google Sheet</a>.</br>
<h1>What's changed with props?</h1><ul>
<li>They've been edited to make more sense mass-wise. Somethings are now too large or heavy to pick up.</li>
<li>Small props and the trap blade can be walked through when they're not moving, so there's less tripping and getting stuck.</li>
<li>Some props that were locked in-place previously can now be moved. E.g. the truck on Overwatch.</li>
<li>Explosive barrels and other destructable props now take 2 minutes to respawn. Twice the normal.</li></ul>
<h1>What's changed with weapons/health/armor?</h1><ul>
<li>Helped balanced Combine vs Rebel by multipling chest damage done to rebels by 1.5. Mr. Jingle finally has an upside.</li>
<li>The pistols damage has been reduced by 1, ar2 damage by 2, shotgun pellets by 3 and magnum by 30.</li>
<li>Double-barrel shotgun blasts have a basic lag compensation fix to improve reg.</li>
<li>SLAMs have been replaced by Combine Mines. Not very useful, but cute when trying to flip back over.</li>
<li>Orb ammo spawns as now armor batteries and rocket ammo spawns are orbs. This change works surprisingly well on most maps.</li>
<li>Due to (usually) less orbs, max armor via Super Charger is reduced to only 150.</li>
<li>Removed deafening from explosions, but that also reduced their total damage. Could be worse.</li></ul>
<h1>What's coming soon?</h1><ul>
<li>Spawning will fully invisible to make spawn killing/camping no longer an issue.</li>
<li>Kill, Specate and Jointeam are suppose to be time delayed to prevent trolling. For now they're blocked.</li>
<li>Reducing knock-back from being shot. Nades are fine, bullets shouldn't make you fly.</li>
<li>Triggers to play built-in sounds and voices. Adds character.</li></ul>
