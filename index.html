<h1>Changes made to this server for fun:</h1><ul>
<li>Many item spawns have been swapped around. It's both for balance and to freshen things up.</li>
<li>Movement speed has been multipled by 1.25 and gravity reduced to 400.</li>
<li>Charging speed has been multiplied by 2. Super chargers max out at 150 rather than 200.</li>
<li>Chest damage to rebels has been multipled by 1.5.</li>
<li>Respawn time for destructable props has been multiplied by 2</li>
<li>The pistol damage has been reduced by 1, ar2 and shotgun pellets by 2, and magnum by 30.</li>
<li>Small props and the trap blades can be walked through when they're not moving, so there's less tripping and getting stuck.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Changes to patch issues with game itself:</h1><ul>
<li>Removed sound effects that can get caught in loop. This has the side effect of reducing explosion damage a bit.</li>
<li>The small gas tanks explosions now do reasonable damage rather than only 1 hp.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Changes currently being worked on:</h1><ul>
<li>Reduce knock-back from being shot. -No ETA, not sure how to do this.</li>
<li>A better model selector that includes more stock models. -Awaiting plugin from Lacy.</li>
<li>Implimenting more stock say sounds. -VPK files for linux seem a bit different, will need to go through them.</li>
</ul></pre></body></html>
