<h1>Changes made to this server for fun:</h1><ul>
<li>Added a lot of event and say sounds. More will be added as thought of.</li>
<li>Adding the best bots I could find and tweaked them as best I could. Expect to be killed.</li>
<li>All body parts have different damage multipliers. Head is 5, chest + stomach is 3, arms are 2 and legs are 1.5.</li>
<li>Charging speed has been multiplied by 2. Super chargers max out at 150 rather than 200.</li>
<li>Due to the multipliers being in effect, damage of all hitscan guns has been slightly tweaked. Shotgun reg feels better.</li>
<li>Movement speed has been multipled by 1.25 and gravity reduced to 450.</li>
<li>Respawn time for all destructable props is now 2 minutes, even if they didn't respawn before.</li>
<li>Small props and the trap blades can be walked through when they're not moving, so there's less tripping and getting stuck.</li>
<li>Some ammo spawns have been swapped around. It's both for balance and to freshen things up.</li>
<li>You spawn with a crossbow and 15 armor. I recommend you get moving quickly and make good use of them.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Changes to patch issues with game itself:</h1><ul>
<li>Removed most sound effects that can get caught in loop. This has the side effect of reducing explosion damage a bit.</li>
<li>The idle "T" body animation that tends to appear while you're in the air is a lot less likely to appear.</li>
<li>The small gas tanks explosions now do reasonable damage rather than only 1 hp.</li>
<li>Weapons priorites have been altered so it's less likely your gun will autoswitch them you pick up ammo and the like.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Changes currently being worked on:</h1><ul>
<li>Probably need to make waypoints for the bots so more maps can be played.</li>
<li>Some props still need tweaks, like setting round props set to server-side so they're less likely to get out of sync.</li>
</ul></pre></body></html>
