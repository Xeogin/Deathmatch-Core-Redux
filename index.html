<h2>Highlighting various styles of play, this server offers the following modes:</h2><ul>
<li>Practice:  It features the some of the most realistic bots in the game and they've been given a 25% speed boost over you. In addition to your normal spawn weapons, you start with a crossbow and 15 armor. It's also infinite sprint and gravity is slightly lower than normal.</li></br>
<li>Low Grav:  As expected, gravity is greatly reduced and fall damage has been disabled. In addition to the Practice mode weapons, you also start with a shotgun and an SMG nade. To makes things more interesting, now everyone has the 25% speed boost.</li></br>
<li>Standard:  You spawn with the same weapon load-out as Practice, but that's the only major change over stock.</li></br>
<li>Competitive:  No spawn protection, no special load-outs, basically stock everything except for some fine tuning to the maps.</li></br>
<li>Fishing:  You spawn with only a gravity gun, but there will be fishing rods and "bait" nearby. Put the bait on a hook then bob it around in the water and nearly any asset from HL2 could spawn. You may also reel in few of the secret items and learn there's more to the map than meets the eye...</li></br>
<li>Capture the Flag:  Uses the same rules as Competitive, but in addition you receive 10 points for each flag capture.</li></ul>
<h3>In addition to these modes, you may notice other subtle changes, such as...</h3><ul>
<li>To help prevent becoming stuck when spawning in, you can walk through small, stationary props and a few props have been fixed in place. Inversely, some props that are usual fixed in place can now be moved, others have increased mass to improve prop-jumping and various map bugs have been fixed, such as the AR2 spawn on dm_resistance, the RPG spawn on dm_lostarena_rpg or the forgotten ladder on dm_ff_wild_wild_west_beta6. I've also begun to throw in some secrets; like have you ever wondered why there's 357 ammo on dm_resistance, but no magnum spawn? Well now there is one and it's in the hiding place it should've been all along. Try and find it!</li>
<li>To help rebalance the game some, SLAM spawns have been replaced with health vials and shotgun buckshot spawns with a single SLAM (unless you're playing Competitive mode.) Additionally, RPGs only come with a one rocket, but it's splash damage has been increased. Damage to legs has been reduced as well as slightly to arms, the Super Charger maxes out at 150 armor and some of the ammo spawns have been swapped with lower capacity versions or armor batteries.</li></ul>
I'd like to thank everyone for you continued feedback and suggestions and a special thanks to Fay the Space Dog for coming up with bot names!
