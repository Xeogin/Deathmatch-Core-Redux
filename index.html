<h3>Jan 2022 Update:</h3>
It took a while, but all the functionality I wanted to rebuild after the server was lost is restored and/or improved! The server is also starting to go in another direction, all feedback is welcome as the new goal is to increase the player base. :)
<h3>Game Modes:</h3>
<ul><li>Deathmatch: This is the standard mode, it also allows for Team Deathmatch and Competitive match mode</li></br>
<li>Bots: Face off against some of the most realistic bots in the game, due to engine limitations they’re hard to hit with props and orbs though</li></br>
<li>Capture the Flag: Work with your team to infiltrate the opposing teams’ base and take their flag back to yours. You receive 10 points for each capture</li></br>
<li>Fishing: Grab a rod, bait your hook, then bob it around in the water and nearly any asset from HL2 could spawn as well as a few secrets</li></br>
<li>Grav Only: You spawn with only a gravity gun, so go ham and kill everyone with anything you can throw</li></br>
<li>Jumps: Use strafe jumps and bhop to complete each map. A persistent checkpoint system is in place to allow you to save your progress</li></br>
<li>Killbox: Gravity is greatly reduced, fall damage has been disabled and you’ve been given a 25% speed boost</li></br>
<li>Surf: Slide down ramps to gain speed and use increased air control to help with transitions. The same checkpoint system as Jumps is enabled here</li></ul></br>
I'd like to thank everyone for your continued feedback and suggestions. Special thanks to Fay the Space Dog for helping come up with bot names!
