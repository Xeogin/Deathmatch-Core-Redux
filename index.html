<h1>What's the goal here?</h1>
Show off the best parts of HL2:DM in a way that keeps Pros happy while helping those with less experience have fun too.
General changes are listed below and futher details are in <a href="https://goo.gl/lZB8gh">this Google Sheet</a>.</br>
<h1>What's changed with props?</h1><ul>
<li>They've been edited to make more sense mass-wise. Somethings are now too large or heavy to pick up.</li>
<li>Small props and the trap blades can be walked through when they're not moving, so there's less tripping and getting stuck.</li>
<li>Some props that were locked in-place previously can now be moved. E.g. the truck on Overwatch.</li>
<li>Explosive barrels and other destructable props now take 2 minutes to respawn. Twice the normal.</li></ul>
<h1>What's changed with weapons/health/armor?</h1><ul>
<li>Helped balanced Combine vs Rebel by multipling chest damage done to rebels by 1.5. Mr. Jingle finally has some upside.</li>
<li>The pistol damage has been reduced by 1, ar2 and shotgun pellets by 2, and magnum by 30.</li>
<li>Many item spawns have been swapped around. It's both for balance and fun.</li>
<li>All charging is now twice as fast to keep things moving. The Super Charger maximum has been reduced to 150 to limit abuse.</li>
<li>Removed deafening from explosions, but that also reduced their total damage. Could be worse honestly.</li></ul>
<h1>What's coming soon?</h1><ul>
<li>Kill/Explode and Specate are suppose to be time delayed to prevent trolling and exploits. For now they're blocked.</li>
<li>Reducing knock-back from being shot. Nades are fine, bullets shouldn't make you fly.</li></ul>
