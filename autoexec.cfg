//  Xeogin's OrangeRox Config - Last Updated 11/27/19
//Inspiration comes from Maxtasy's Competitive Config 1.2 for HL2:DM, Chris' Highframes Config v2.016 for TF2, MasterComs' mastercomfig v8 for TF2 and reading some CS:S & CS:GO recommendations on reddit. Everything has been tested on multiple platforms so that this can be used without much work on your part.

//  Prologue
//The following config doesn't touch any of the settings that can be accessed via the in-game menu unless they're broken in the game itself or the alternative options are pointless. It also doesn't enforce any default settings, so if you'd made edits in the past, you may want to delete your settings.scr and config.cfg files before applying this file for the best experience, then adjust your in-game settings again to match your desired quality level, etc. Additionally, some settings here are suggestions or opinionated. Please read the comments to decide what's best for you and your setup.
