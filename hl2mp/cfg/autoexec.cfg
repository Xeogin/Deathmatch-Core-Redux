//  Xeogin's OrangeRox Config - Last Updated 1/22/17
//Originalily based on Maxtasy's Competivite Config 1.2 for HL2:DM and Chris' Highframes Config v2.016 for TF2
//Many inspirations from CS:S & CS:GO recommendations as well as through my own experimentation

//  Prologue
//The following config doesn't touch any of the settings that can be accessed via the in-game menu unless they're broken in the game itself. It also doesn't enforce any default settings. As such it's recommended that you delete your config.cfg file before applying this file for the best experience, then adjust your in-game settings again to match your desired quality level, etc. Some settings here are suggestions or opinionated. Please read the comments to deside what's best for you and your setup.

//  Settings you may want to change
