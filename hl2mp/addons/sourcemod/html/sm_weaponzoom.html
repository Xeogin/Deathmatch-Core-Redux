<h1>Weapon Zoom Help</h2>
<P>
Weapon Zoom is a custom, multi-step zoom plugin.  Depending how your Game
Server Operator has configured the plugin, there will be varying levels of
zoom and functionality.
</P>
<h2>Using Zoom</h2>
<P>
By default the 357 has Weapon Zoom Enabled.  Others such as the pistol may also be configured.

<ul>
<li><B>Zoom In x1</B>: Simply use your alternate attack (attack2) to increase your zoom level.</li>
<li><B>Zoom Out x1</b>: Hold down your "walk" key (default is "alt") while pressing attack2.</li>
<li><B>Turn off Zoom:</b> Using Suit zoom while you are zoomed in will unzoom your view completely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Custom Binds</h2>
<P>
Weapon Zoom also supports console binds for custom key or mouse actions.  
</P>
<P>
These example console commands bind your mouse wheels "up", "down" and "5th button" to zoom in, zoom out, and unzoom.
</P>
<pre>
 bind mwheelup weaponzoom_in
 bind mwheeldown weaponzoom_out
 bind mouse5 weaponzoom_unzoom
</pre>


<h2>Settings</h2>
<P>
The following settings can be configured by individual players, and is accessible through the Weapon Zoom Settings menu by typing in chat: <code>!settings</code> or <code>!weaponzoom</code>
